# statsbombpy_import

Use this repository to import the code for loading statsbomb data for python and all necessary libraries.

This will be useful for many future events of the IE Sports Analytics Club.
This repo was for an event that used AFCON 2023 data. Adjust the code to fit in the competition you would like to import.
